# Practice  for Library Management in java

### This project  is a practice on the  java console 

### Base of the project
<p> The following is the definition of a very simplified library information system. It contains members, who register with the library and can then borrow books from the library.

A member is characterized by a membership number, a name and an address; in addition, the number of books that a member has borrowed, and whether he has more than ten books, can be known at any given time.

For each book, its code, title, author and whether or not it is available are known; in addition, the location of the book in the library can be known at any time, as well as the book's call number.

A book can be moved to another location, and its reference number can also be changed; in fact, whenever the reference number of a book is changed, it is because it has been moved to another location.

Books are lent to members, and as a consequence the notion of loan appears; a loan will be characterized, in addition to the code of the lent book and the number of the member, by the date of the loan.

On the other hand, members who have more than 10 books on loan will also be monitored, and the application will take care of this, so that these members will temporarily specialize in unreliable members. </p>
